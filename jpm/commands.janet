    usage: jpm [--key=value, --flag] ... [subcommand] [args] ...

    Run from a directory containing a project.janet file to perform
    operations on a project, or from anywhere to do operations on the
    global module cache (modpath).  Commands that need write permission to
    the modpath are considered privileged commands - in some environments
    they may require super user privileges.  Other project-level commands
    need to have a ./project.janet file in the current directory.

    To install/manage packages in a local subtree, use the --local flag
    (or -l) to install packages to ./jpm_tree. This should generally not
    require elevated privileges.

    Unprivileged global subcommands:

        help
            Show this help text.

        show-paths
            Prints the paths that will be used to install things.

        quickbin entry executable
            Create an executable from a janet script with a main function.

    Privileged global subcommands:

        install (repo or name)...
            Install artifacts. If a repo is given, install the contents of
            that git repository, assuming that the repository is a jpm
            project. If not, build and install the current project.

        uninstall (module)...
            Uninstall a module. If no module is given, uninstall the
            module defined by the current directory.

        clear-cache
            Clear the git cache. Useful for updating dependencies.

        clear-manifest
            Clear the manifest. Useful for fixing broken installs.

        make-lockfile (lockfile)
            Create a lockfile based on repositories in the cache. The
            lockfile will record the exact versions of dependencies used
            to ensure a reproducible build. Lockfiles are best used with
            applications, not libraries. The default lockfile name is
            lockfile.jdn.

        load-lockfile (lockfile)
            Install modules from a lockfile in a reproducible way. The
            default lockfile name is lockfile.jdn.

        update-pkgs
            Update the current package listing from the remote git
            repository selected.

        exec
            Run any shell command with JANET_PATH set to the correct
            module tree.

        janet
            Run the Janet interpreter with JANET_PATH set to the correct
            module tree.

    Privileged project subcommands:

        deps
            Install dependencies for the current project.

        install
            Install artifacts of the current project.

        uninstall
            Uninstall the current project's artifacts.

    Unprivileged project subcommands:

        build
            Build all artifacts in the build/ directory, or the value specified in --buildpath.

        configure path
            Create a directory for out-of-tree builds, and also set project options. 

        clean
            Remove any generated files or artifacts.

        test
            Run tests. Tests should be .janet files in the test/ directory
            relative to project.janet. Will patch the module paths to load
            built native code without installing it.

        run rule
            Run a rule. Can also run custom rules added via `(phony "task"
            [deps...] ...)` or `(rule "ouput.file" [deps...] ...)`.

        rules
            List rules available with run.

        list-installed
            List installed packages in the current syspath.

        list-pkgs (search)
            List packages in the package listing that the contain the
            string search.  If no search pattern is given, prints the
            entire package listing.

        rule-tree (root rule) (depth)
            Print a nice tree to see what rules depend on other rules.
            Optionally provide a root rule to start printing from, and a
            max depth to print. Without these options, all rules will
            print their full dependency tree.

        repl
            Run a repl in the same environment as the test environment. Allows
            you to use built natives without installing them.

        debug-repl
            Run a repl in the context of the current project.janet
            file. This lets you run rules and otherwise debug the current
            project.janet file.

        save-config path
            Save the input configuration to a file.
