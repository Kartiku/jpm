jpm \- the Janet Project Manager, a build tool for Janet
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B jpm
[\fB\-\-flag ...\fR]
[\fB\-\-option=value ...\fR]
.IR command
.IR args ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
jpm is the build tool that ships with a standard Janet install. It is
used for building Janet projects, installing dependencies, installing
projects, building native modules, and exporting your Janet project to a
standalone executable. Although not required for working with Janet, it
removes much of the boilerplate with installing dependencies and
building native modules. jpm requires only Janet to run, and uses git
to install dependencies (jpm will work without git installed).
.SH DOCUMENTATION

jpm has several subcommands, each used for managing either a single Janet project or
all Janet modules installed on the system. Global commands, those that manage modules
at the system level, do things like install and uninstall packages, as well as clear the cache.
More interesting are the local commands. For more information on jpm usage, see https://janet-lang.org/docs/index.html

For information on flags, see the usage documentation in the tool.

.SH COMMANDS
.TP
.BR help
Shows the usage text and exits immediately.

.TP
.BR build
Builds all artifacts specified in the project.janet file in the current directory. Artifacts will
be created in the ./build/ directory.

.TP
.BR configure [\fBpath\fR]
Create a directory for out-of-tree builds, and also set project options. While jpm does not
require an explicit configure step, this can be used to avoid needing to set the same options
repeatedly. Out of tree builds are also a convenient way to have multiple configurations at the
same time, such as a relase build and a debug build.

.TP
.BR install\ [\fBrepo...\fR]
When run with no arguments, installs all installable artifacts in the current project to
the current JANET_MODPATH for modules and JANET_BINPATH for executables and scripts. Can also
take an optional git repository URL and will install all artifacts in that repository instead.
When run with an argument, install does not need to be run from a jpm project directory. Will also
install multiple dependencies in one command.

.TP
.BR uninstall\ [\fBname...\fR]
Uninstall a project installed with install. uninstall expects the name of the project, not the
repository url, path to installed file, or executable name. The name of the project must be specified
at the top of the project.janet file in the declare-project form. If no name is given, uninstalls
the current project if installed. Will also uninstall multiple packages in one command.

.TP
.BR clean
Remove all artifacts created by jpm. This just deletes the build folder.

.TP
.BR test
Runs jpm tests. jpm will run all janet source files in the test directory as tests. A test
is considered failing if it exits with a non-zero exit code.

.TP
.BR deps
Install all dependencies that this project requires recursively. jpm does not
resolve dependency issues, like conflicting versions of the same module are required, or
different modules with the same name. Dependencies are installed with git, so deps requires
git to be on the PATH.

.TP
.BR clear-cache
jpm caches git repositories that are needed to install modules from a remote
source in a global cache ($JANET_PATH/.cache). If these dependencies are out of
date or too large, clear-cache will remove the cache and jpm will rebuild it
when needed. clear-cache is a global command, so a project.janet is not
required.

.TP
.BR list-installed
List all installed packages in the current syspath.

.TP
.BR list-pkgs\ [\fBsearch\fR]
List all package aliases in the current package listing that contain the given search string.
If no search string is given, prints the entire listing.

.TP
.BR clear-manifest
jpm creates a manifest directory that contains a list of all installed files.
By deleting this directory, jpm will think that nothing is installed and will
try reinstalling everything on the jpm deps or jpm load-lockfile commands. Be careful with
this command, as it may leave extra files on your system and shouldn't be needed
most of the time in a healthy install.

.TP
.BR run\ [\fBrule\fR]
Run a given rule defined in project.janet. Project definitions files (project.janet) usually
contain a few artifact declarations, which set up rules that jpm can then resolve, or execute.
A project.janet can also create custom rules to create arbitrary files or run arbitrary code, much
like make. run will run a single rule or build a single file.

.TP
.BR rules
List all rules that can be run via run. This is useful for exploring rules in the project.

.TP
.BR rule-tree\ [\fBroot\fR]\ [\fBdepth\fR]
Show rule dependency tree in a pretty format. Optionally provide a rule to use as the tree
root, as well as a max depth to print. By default, prints the full tree for all rules. This
can be quite long, so it is recommended to give a root rule.

.TP
.BR show-paths
Show all of the paths used when installing and building artifacts.

.TP
.BR update-pkgs
Update the package listing by installing the 'pkgs' package. Same as jpm install pkgs

.TP
.BR quickbin\ [\fBentry\fR]\ [\fBexecutable\fR]
Create a standalone, statically linked executable from a Janet source file that contains a main function.
The main function is the entry point of the program and will receive command line arguments
as function arguments. The entry file can import other modules, including native C modules, and
jpm will attempt to include the dependencies into the generated executable.

.TP
.BR repl
Run a repl in the same environment as the test environment. Allows
you to use built natives without installing them.

.TP
.BR debug-repl
Load the current project.janet file and start a repl in it's environment. This lets a user better
debug the project file, as well as run rules manually.

.TP
.BR make-lockfile\ [\fBfilename\fR]
Create a lockfile. A lockfile is a record that describes what dependencies were installed at the
time of the lockfile's creation, including exact versions. A lockfile can then be later used
to set up that environment on a different machine via load-lockfile. By default, the lockfile
is created at lockfile.jdn, although any path can be used.

.TP
.BR load-lockfile\ [\fBfilename\fR]
Install dependencies from a lockfile previously created with make-lockfile. By default, will look
for a lockfile at lockfile.jdn, although any path can be used.

.SH ENVIRONMENT

.B JANET_TREE
.RS
A convenient way to set the modpath, binpath, syspath, and manpath all at once. This is equivalent to the
--tree parameter to jpm.
.RE

.B JANET_PATH
.RS
The location to look for Janet libraries. This is the only environment variable Janet needs to
find native and source code modules. If no JANET_PATH is set, Janet will look in
the default location set at compile time, which can be determined with (dyn :syspath)
.RE

.B JANET_MODPATH
.RS
The location that jpm will use to install libraries to. Defaults to JANET_PATH, but you could
set this to a different directory if you want to. Doing so would let you import Janet modules
on the normal system path (JANET_PATH or (dyn :syspath)), but install to a different directory. It is also a more reliable way to install.
This variable is overwritten by the --modpath=/some/path if it is provided.
.RE

.B JANET_HEADERPATH
.RS
The location that jpm will look for janet header files (janet.h and janetconf.h) that are used
to build native modules and standalone executables. If janet.h and janetconf.h are available as
default includes on your system, this value is not required. If not provided, will default to
<jpm script location>/../include/janet. The --headerpath=/some/path option will override this
variable.
.RE

.B JANET_LIBPATH
.RS
Similar to JANET_HEADERPATH, this path is where jpm will look for
libjanet.a for creating standalone executables. This does not need to be
set on a normal install.
If not provided, this will default to <jpm script location>/../lib.
The --libpath=/some/path option will override this variable.
.RE

.B JANET_BINPATH
.RS
The directory where jpm will install binary scripts and executables to.
Defaults to
(dyn :syspath)/bin
The --binpath=/some/path will override this variable.
.RE

.B JANET_BUILDPATH
.RS
The directory where jpm will put intermediate files, object code, and compiled executables.
Defaults to ./build
The --buildpath=/some/path will override this variable. You should make that directories above this
directory exist before building.
.RE

.B JANET_PKGLIST
.RS
The git repository URL that contains a listing of packages. This allows installing packages with shortnames, which
is mostly a convenience. However, package dependencies can use short names, package listings
can be used to choose a particular set of dependency versions for a whole project.
.RE

.B JANET_GIT
.RS
An optional path to a git executable to use to clone git dependencies. By default, uses "git" on the current $PATH. You shouldn't need to set this
if you have a normal install of git.
.RE

.B JANET_JPM_CONFIG
.RS
An optional path to a config file to load. This option is overriden by the --config-file command
line option.
